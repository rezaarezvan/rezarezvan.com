      <description>Introduction In data science, classification stands out as a fundamental technique. It involves the art of categorizing data into distinct classes based on various features and attributes.&#xA;Different type of classifiers Within the arsenal of classification algorithms, we encounter a diverse array of tools. From the simplicity of Logistic Regression to the complexity of Support Vector Machines, each classifier brings its unique strengths to the table.&#xA;Measuring Distances The most common metric for distance is euclidean distance: $$ d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} |q_i - p_i|^2} $$</description>

      <description>Introduction In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the very large and mystical field of data science and AI. We&amp;rsquo;re going to spend these first few parts to understand what data science is.&#xA;Data science What is data science? (Theoretical) Computer science is method-driven and often abstract. In data science, the question is often answered with insights derived from the data.&#xA;Data scientists aim for results that can describe the world, or a business sector, that needs it.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll understand the concept of filters.&#xA;Filters We usually use filters for two different purposes:&#xA;Frequency elimination Frequency detection Example Say we have the following system: $$ G(s) = \dfrac{a}{s + a} $$&#xA;What type of filter is this? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out. Plotting the bode plot will help us.&#xA;Note: This is for $a = 1$&#xA;We can see that this is a low-pass filter! We will call the part that lets through the frequency for passband.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we define a general feedback loop.&#xA;General controller structure Assume the general structure for a feedback loop.&#xA;However, we now have some noise that is added (in theory the sign can be whatever) to our out signal. Additionally, the noise, $V(s)$ will go through a process, $G_v(s)$.&#xA;Along with this noise we have some noise in the feedback loop as well, so-called measurement error.</description>

      <description>Signals A signal is a set of information or data. Any physical quantity that varies over time, space or any other variable or variables.&#xA;Even, Odd &amp;amp; Periodic An even function is symmetrical about the vertical axis. Mathematically this means: $$ f(t) = f(-t) \\ f[k] = f[-k] $$&#xA;An odd function is anti-symmetrical about the vertical axis. Mathematically this means: $$ f(t) = -f(-t) \\ f[k] = -f[-k] $$</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover Green&amp;rsquo;s Theorem, which will allow us to have a relationship between integrals and double integrals.&#xA;Before starting, we will only work with simple curves. Which essentially just means that the curves have no self-injections (only exception is when it starts and ends at the same point).&#xA;If $C$ is a simple and closed curve, e.g a circle.

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll define higher partial derivatives and how we define if a function with several variables is differentiable.&#xA;Higher partial derivatives In the last part we defined what partial derivatives were: $$ f_x = \lim{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h, y) - f(x, y)}{h} $$&#xA;We can now derive this function again: $$ f_{xx} = \lim{h \to 0} \dfrac{f_x(x + h, y) - f_x(x, y)}{h} $$&#xA;$$ f_{xy} = \lim{h \to 0} \dfrac{f_x(x, y + h) - f_x(x, y)}{h} $$</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll define continuity when dealing with functions with several variables. We&amp;rsquo;ll also start looking at derivatives of functions of several variables.&#xA;Continuity Let&amp;rsquo;s recall what continuity of a function with one variable is defined:&#xA;A function of one variable is continuous at a point, $a \in D$ if:&#xA;$$ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) $$&#xA;In functions with several variables, it&amp;rsquo;s the same: $$ \lim_{(x, y) \to (a, b)} f(x, y) = f(a, b) $$</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll define Power for AC circuits, we&amp;rsquo;ve had all the tools now for a while, but just never applied them.&#xA;Power in AC circuits and be divided into three categories:&#xA;Resistive load $(\theta = 0)$. Inductive load $(Z = \omega L \angle 90^{\circ})$. Capacitive load* $(Z = \dfrac{1}{\omega C} \angle -90^{\circ})$. Resistive Load When we have a resistive load, meaning no phase shift. Then our Voltage and Current are: $$ V(t) = V_m cos(\omega t) \newline I(t) = I_m cos(\omega t) $$</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover so-called virtual memory - which is an essential technique used in computer engineering.&#xA;Virtual memory is a technique used by computers to allow them to use more memory than physically exists in the system. Now, this may seem odd at a first glance, how can we use more memory than physically exists?&#xA;It works by temporarily transferring data from the computer&amp;rsquo;s main memory (RAM) to a designated area on the secondary memory (hard-drive).</description>

      <description>When analyzing and computing with circuits, it&amp;rsquo;s often a good idea to try to simply as much as possible.&#xA;But when met with a circuit like: We can try all we want to simplify it, with our current knowledge, we simply can&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;So let&amp;rsquo;s learn about Node-Voltage analysis.&#xA;Node-Voltage analysis Below is a picture that illustrates the idea: Here&amp;rsquo;s the idea:&#xA;Find the nodes Assign a reference node (usually, we pick the node with most connections) Assign node voltages (Note, in a circuit with, $N$, nodes we have, $N - 1$, voltages) Then we solve these using KCL on each node ($\sum\ i_{out} = \sum\ i_{in}$) The convention is also the following:</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll properly cover the MIPS architecture in depth.&#xA;Parameter transferring When calling a function in C code, what is happening at the assembler level is, calling a subroutine (usually).&#xA;What we need to do before a subroutine call, is the following:&#xA;Place the input parameters into their respective registers Call the function/subroutine Allocate memory for eventual saved and local variables Execute the function/procedure Place the result in a register Reset the stack, if needed Return to where the function/subroutine got called.</description>

      <description>In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll understand and learn how to compute, quantify and, measure the performance of different systems and programs.&#xA;To compute, quantify and, measure performance let&amp;rsquo;s start by first defining what performance depends on.&#xA;Performance dependencies When we&amp;rsquo;re making a system or a program a lot of different factors will weigh in the total performance:&#xA;The underlying algorithm&#xA;Determines number of operations required, which directly impacts the performance.

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover and properly define a very misunderstood concept in physics, power and energy.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with defining power properly.&#xA;Power Power can be defined as:&#xA;Rate of energy transferred, or work done, per unit of time.&#xA;In electrial circuits, we can define power, $P$, as: $$ P = V \cdot\ I $$&#xA;We measure power in watts, which we can define as: $$ 1\ W = \frac{1\ J}{s} = \frac{1\ N \cdot\ m}{s} = 1 kg \cdot\ m^{2} \cdot\ s^{-3} $$</description>

      <description>When creating digital circuits, there are a lot of things that can go wrong.&#xA;When designing the circuit, it may happen that the designers have implemented a bug into the circuit.&#xA;We call these design bugs. On the other hand, when physically making the chip, it may happen that we get permanent (implementation) fault, or other (transient) faults.&#xA;In the first case we need to perform verification, in the latter case, it&amp;rsquo;s testing and fault tolerance.</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the synchronization challenges that arise when designing (correct) and efficient parallelizations.&#xA;But let&amp;rsquo;s first see the burdens with locks&#xA;The trouble with locks Standard techniques for concurrent programming are ultimately based on locks.&#xA;Programming with locks has several drawbacks:&#xA;Performance overhead.&#xA;Lock granularity is hard to choose:&#xA;Not enough locking: race conditions.&#xA;Too much locking: not enough parallelism.&#xA;Risk of deadlock and starvation.&#xA;Lock-based implementations do not compose (easily).</description>

      <description>When designing digital circuits, the timing, delay and power usage of the circuit are important. In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how we usually measure and compare these.&#xA;Timing and delay In an arbitrary synchronous circuit, we usually have:&#xA;A single-bit clock, all other wires may be multiple bits wide. Registers (Which is just a collection of flip-flops). The clock will be distributed to all flip-flops Combinational logic No internal state Output only a function of input(s) Particular inputs/outputs are optional Optional feedback(-loops).</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the classical problems that occur when dealing with synchronization.&#xA;But within this paradigm, we don&amp;rsquo;t encounter the same problems as when using semaphores. Mutual exclusion is not an issue, since we never share any resource, the big problem today will be synchronization and coordination.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll see that many problems have the solution of a server-client architecture.&#xA;Barriers Let&amp;rsquo;s quickly recap what our barriers should be able to do:</description>

      <description>As we discussed in the first part of this series, there two main paradigms.&#xA;ASIC and reconfigurable Hardware&#xA;ASIC Advantages Very high performance and efficient. Disadvantages Not flexible (can&amp;rsquo;t be altered after fabrication). High cost. Reconfigurable computing Advantages Much higher performance than software, lower than ASIC. Higher level of flexibility than ASIC, more difficult to program than software. Software-programmed processors Advantages Very flexible to change. Disadvantages Performance can suffer if the clock speed isn&amp;rsquo;t fast enough.</description>

      <description>So far we have looked at threads which share memory. The so-called shared memory model, but in this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover distributed memory model, specifically, message-passing concurrency.&#xA;For this we&amp;rsquo;ll cover and use the programming language, Erlang!&#xA;So let&amp;rsquo;s quickly have a crash course over Erlang!&#xA;What is Erlang? Erlang is a functional programming language with message-passing features. The message-passing part is concurrent and implements the actor model, where Erlang processes are actors.</description>

      <description>In this series we&amp;rsquo;ve covered locks and semaphores as synchronization mechanism. Although these are essential in concurrent programs, they&amp;rsquo;re quite low-level synchronization mechanisms.&#xA;Semaphores for example have the problem that:&#xA;They are global and unstructured, it can be quite difficult to understand what a certain semaphore does in a given piece of code. Often, we are prone to deadlocks or incorrect behavior, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget a simple up() or down() call in your programs.</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover arithmetic units. Specifically multipliers and divers.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover some number representations.&#xA;Arithmetic Units It may be common knowledge that, when we want to perform multiplication and division, by powers of 2, we perform so-called shift operations on the bits.&#xA;If we for example want to multiply a number with the binary number 100, or 4 in decimal.&#xA;We would just shift all bits two steps to the left.</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how to solve some classical synchronization problems using threads and semaphores.&#xA;Dining Philosophers To refresh our memory on the problem let&amp;rsquo;s cover it again:&#xA;The dining philosophers problem describes how to avoid deadlock (circular conditions).&#xA;We have five philosophers (threads) sitting at a dining table. A fork is between each adjacent pair of philosophers.&#xA;Each philosopher alternates between thinking (non-critical section) and eating (critical section). In order to eat, a philosopher needs to pick up both forks that lie to the right and left of the philosopher.</description>

      <description>In the last part we covered sequential circuits, in this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover Finite State Machines.&#xA;FSMs are type of sequential circuits, there are two main type of FSMs, Moore and Mealy.&#xA;Moore FSMs Outputs depends only on the state. Mealy FSMs Outputs depend on both state and primary inputs. 1-1 Detector A 1-1 detector, generates an output, $z = 1$, whenever the input, $w$ is 1 twice in a row (clock cycles).</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how we can achieve mutual exclusion in a program using only atomic read and writes.&#xA;Analyzing Concurrency When analyzing concurrent programs we often look at states and transitions.&#xA;A state in these diagrams are possible program states. Transitions on the other hand, connects these states to an execution order.&#xA;One to thing to note is that, the structural properties in these diagrams, captures the semantics properties of the corresponding program.</description>

      <description>Sequential Circuits When we usually look at circuits we have an input and output who are independent on each other. In a sequential circuit, as the name suggest, we have a sequence. Meaning we feed back our output as input.&#xA;We can easily define this as: Our output no longer depends on the present input - but on the past behavior of the circuit.&#xA;State-Holding Memory Elements We&amp;rsquo;ve encountered latches and flip-flops before, they have a so-called memory element to them.</description>

      <description>In the last part we covered the basics and some principles for concurrent programs. In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how we define concurrent problems, the outcome we want and some solutions.&#xA;Races As we saw in the last part - a different trace leads to a different outcome - this means that concurrent programs are non-deterministic.&#xA;Why concurrent programs are non-deterministic is due to the scheduler&amp;rsquo;s decisions.&#xA;When we have a problem with different possible outcomes, we need to label what is a faulty run and a successful run.</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover different kind of (binary) adders that digital circuits use. They&amp;rsquo;re an essential part for all the arithmetic operations which are needed.&#xA;Full Adder The (1-bit) full adder is the simplest adder unit we can create.&#xA;It takes two input bits $a$ and $b$, with $c_{in}$ (carry in) - it outputs two bit signals, $c_{out}$ and $r$&#xA;If we use a truth table and find a boolean function for it, we find that: $$ r = a\ \bar{b}\ \bar{c_{in}} + \bar{a}\ b\ \bar{c_{in}} + a\ b\ c_{in} + \bar{a}\ \bar{b}\ c_{in} $$</description>

      <description>Concurrency, multi-threading, parallelism. These are all big terms thrown around in the computer-science world. For an outsider it can be quite confusing what these exactly are and how they differ from each other. In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll cover and dive into concurrency and its applications.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by defining what we mean by concurrency.&#xA;Introduction Concurrency, in its very definition is, the fact of two or more events or circumstances happening or existing at the same time.</description>

What are digital circuits built from then? Chips! What are chips built from then? Logical gates! What are logical gates built from then? Transistor circuits! What are these circuits built from?

      <description>One of the core things that makes programming fun in my eyes are the standards and conventions that we&amp;rsquo;ve built. I want to write down my principles that I follow when writing code. I think it&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of every engineer that they have their own guidelines and principles they follow.&#xA;Consistency Before we even dive into an actual programming principle I want to talk about consistency. Guidelines and principles won&amp;rsquo;t even matter if we aren&amp;rsquo;t consistent with them.</description>

We can remove all constants: $$ T(n) = (n^2 + n)(log_{10}(n)) $$&#xA;The next rule we can apply is, &amp;ldquo;the most dominating factor &amp;lsquo;wins&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; as I like to call it.</description>

These represent some kind of &amp;lsquo;cost&amp;rsquo;, usually these are positive float numbers, but they could be anything - although many algorithms only work for positive weights.</description>

The visible light we can see is usually between 380 - 740 nm&#xA;General Conventions As we remember from mechanical waves $v = \lambda f$, this also applies for light waves, but our $v$ is instead $c$. $$ c = \lambda f = 3 \cdot 10^8 m/s $$&#xA;If we look at light like usual mechanical waves, it quickly becomes very cluttered in our sketch.</description>

So a very natural thing is that these edged can be either undirected or directed!&#xA;A node can have a so-called degree describing how many in/outgoing edges it has. In the directed case we split this variable to &amp;lsquo;out degree&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;in degree&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;Another basic term that we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter is a cycle.</description>

      <description>The next chapter in our physics course is about waves, especially mechanical waves.&#xA;General about Waves In this chapter we&amp;rsquo;ll cover mechanical waves but also electromagnetic waves, in this case only (visible) light.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s two types of waves we&amp;rsquo;ll be covering:&#xA;Transverse waves They have &amp;rsquo;noise&amp;rsquo; orthogonal against the wave&amp;rsquo;s propagation speed. Longitudinal waves They have &amp;rsquo;noise&amp;rsquo; parallel with the waves&amp;rsquo; propagation speed. We can describe this noise with the function $y(x, t) = f(x + vt)$.</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover so called &amp;rsquo;trees&amp;rsquo; in computer science.&#xA;Trees The formal definition of a &amp;rsquo;tree&amp;rsquo; is: &amp;ldquo;A hierarchical data structure built up from nodes&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;So unlike a real tree which has its root at the bottom - the computer scientist flipped it - the root node is at the top of the tree.&#xA;In any tree there&amp;rsquo;s always one root node. Each node can have so-called child nodes, and these children can have their own child nodes and so on.</description>

      <description>Hash Tables Hash tables are one of the most famous (and widely used) data structures. But why are they so popular and powerful? Before we can answer that question we need to look back at sets and maps.&#xA;Sets and Maps in Context Just to refresh our memory - a set is a collection of items, where duplicates aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed. Maps are sets of keys, each having an associate value - or you can formulate it as - a set of key-value pairs.</description>

      <description>ADT vs Data Structures So, what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between an Abstract Data Type and an actual data structure?&#xA;An ADT is a kind of specification of something - it specifies how we can interact with that object, like an API.&#xA;It consists of methods and constructors but also plain-text specifications (like the complexity for example) and explanations.&#xA;A data structure on the other hand is an actual implementation of an ADT.</description>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the 2nd law of thermodynamics - as well as summarize this field of physics.&#xA;Direction for $W$ and $Q$ As we&amp;rsquo;ve seen the work, $W$ and $Q$ is quite important. So let&amp;rsquo;s set up some general guide lines.&#xA;Generally, in a given thermal system:&#xA;A expansion, $(V_f &amp;gt; V_i), \rightarrow W &amp;gt; 0$ A compression, $(V_f &amp;lt; V_i), \rightarrow W &amp;lt; 0$&#xA;Increase in temperature $\Delta T &amp;gt; 0, (T_f &amp;gt; T_i), \rightarrow Q &amp;gt; 0$ Decrease in temperature $\Delta T &amp;lt; 0, (T_f &amp;lt; T_i), \rightarrow Q &amp;lt; 0$</description>

      <title>DSA: Part 3 - Dynamic Arrays</title>

      <description>Dynamic arrays Finally we have arrived at the DS of DSA. In (almost) all programming languages the most common built in data structure are arrays. We have seen them, worked with them - nothing new. We&amp;rsquo;ve probably even worked with dynamic arrays, they are an essential data structure - sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t know how much data we&amp;rsquo;ll need.&#xA;But how are dynamic arrays actually implemented into a language? The ideas are actually quite simple - we use a fixed length array and make a larger, fixed length array again, when we have run out of space.</description>

      <description>Ideal gases An &amp;lsquo;ideal&amp;rsquo; gas is a gas that is not subject to interparticle interactions. Also commonly said to not being subject to &amp;lsquo;react with other substances&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;In many applications of thermodynamics, ideal gases often come up, so it&amp;rsquo;s natural to understand them within a thermodynamic perspective.&#xA;Gases and Pressure Before we begin with the real thermodynamical part of gases we need a bit of background with gases. Boyle&amp;rsquo;s law gives us a mathematical formula for our intuition of gases.</description>

      <description>Introduction What do we mean by an &amp;lsquo;Algorithmic complexity&amp;rsquo;, a good (but not fully formal) definition would be - &amp;ldquo;How much resources does the algorithm use in relation to quantitative properties of its input&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And just to be clear, the definition of an algorithm: any well-defined procedure to solve a given problem.&#xA;So what kind of resources could we quantify from an input? Of course the runtime of an algorithm is important.</description>

      <description>My other course for this study period is a course in Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms.&#xA;Sorting &amp;amp; Searching We began this course with sorting and why it&amp;rsquo;s an important topic for a computer scientist. Sorting data comes up in all fields of computer science, everything from low-level, simple, array sorting - to sort millions of data gathered by an AI.&#xA;With this we began with simple sorting and searching algorithms. Firstly we began with binary search.</description>

      <description>In my physics course we have recently began with the thermodynamics part of physics.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s quite overwhelming but at the same time it&amp;rsquo;s really fun. So I&amp;rsquo;ll just post and explain everything I learn in class here - since it&amp;rsquo;s a really good way of learning, explaining. As the late and incredible Richard Feynman once said:&#xA;If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand it - Richard Feynman</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently felt the urge to make some math-related projects and visualization projects. So I picked up Julia and have so far learned the basics of the language - it&amp;rsquo;s a quite simple and dynamic language which I appreciate, especially after my most recent projects have been in C/C++ and Rust - it&amp;rsquo;s a great refresh in programming.&#xA;So far I&amp;rsquo;ve made quite small projects with a lot of built-in libraries.</description>

      <title>Vim-like editor</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to learn Rust for a long time - I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled and manged to learn the basic syntax a while ago. However, you haven&amp;rsquo;t truly learned a language until you made a project and the code would be considered &amp;lsquo;idiomatic&amp;rsquo; - or at least in my opinion.&#xA;So I decided to make a Vim-like text editor. I took a lot of inspiration from this post from medium, so all credits to Kofi.</description>
