			<h1 class="title">Waves: Part 2 - Light waves</h1><p class="single_time">Dec 7, 2022</p></div>
		<section class="post">
			<p>In this part we&rsquo;ll cover light waves and it&rsquo;s properties.</p>
<p>Light is actually electromagnetic radiation. The visible light we can see is usually between 380 - 740 nm</p>
<h3 id="general-conventions">General Conventions</h3>
<p>As we remember from mechanical waves $v = \lambda f$, this also applies for light waves, but our $v$ is instead $c$.
$$
c = \lambda f = 3 \cdot 10^8 m/s
$$</p>
<p>If we look at light like usual mechanical waves, it quickly becomes very cluttered in our sketch.
Therefore we usually draw light as a <em>plane wave</em>. Which usually just means a singular line, instead of many.</p>
<h3 id="refractive-index">Refractive Index</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that if a wave enters a new medium it gains a new velocity, transmission and reflection. The same goes for light.</p>
<p>The refractive index tells us how much <em>slower</em> the light becomes in the new medium, compared to the speed in vacuum (or air, as we usually just set it as the same).</p>
<p>$$
n = \frac{c}{v}
$$
$$
v = \frac{c}{n}
$$</p>
<p>Where v is the new speed in the new medium.</p>
<h3 id="snells-law">Snell&rsquo;s Law</h3>
<p>Snell&rsquo;s law is a formula which describes the relationship between the input angle which a light wave has and after,
along with the different refractive indexes. I&rsquo;m not going to prove it, it&rsquo;s quite simple trigonometry but:
$$
n_1\ sin(\theta_i) = n_2\ sin(\theta_r)
$$</p>
<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>When a wave <em>reflects</em> against a <em>more dense</em> medium (which means a <em>lower</em> propagation speed) - the reflected wave is &lsquo;shifted&rsquo; by $\pi$ rad.</p>
<p>Meaning the reflected wave/pulse/light is the &lsquo;inverse&rsquo; of the input wave, the inputs high becomes the reflections low etc.</p>
<p>When a wave <em>reflects</em> against a <em>less dense</em> medium (which means a <em>higher</em> propagation speed) - the reflected wave is <strong>not</strong> shifted.
Thus the input wave and the reflection wave is the &lsquo;same&rsquo; wave.</p>
<h3 id="interference-with-light">Interference with light</h3>
<p>Imagine we have two glass panes - we put a small object in between, which is almost negligible.
We can imagine that the light <strong>inside</strong> these two glass panes travels a distance of $d$.
Therefore the <strong>total geometric</strong> travel is then $\rightarrow 2d$.</p>
<p>The <strong>optical way</strong> is then $\rightarrow 2d + \frac{\lambda}{2}$</p>
<p>And the <strong>phase difference</strong> is $\rightarrow \frac{2d}{\lambda} \cdot 2\pi + \pi$</p>
<p>We achieve constructive interference if:
$$
2d + \frac{\lambda}{2} = m\lambda
\newline
2d = m\lambda - \frac{\lambda}{2}
$$</p>
<p>Where $m = 1, 2, 3, \dots$</p>
<h3 id="youngs-interference-experiment">Young&rsquo;s interference experiment</h3>
<p>This is quite a visual proof/experiment and I&rsquo;m too lazy currently to fix pictures for this sooo:
$$
d \cdot sin(\theta) = m\lambda
$$</p>
<p>This results in a &lsquo;maxima&rsquo; or when it shines light - then we have 0th maxima, 1st maxima and so on.</p>
<p>And for minima:
$$
d sin(\theta) = (2m + 1)\ \frac{\lambda}{2}
$$</p>
<p>And just a general formula for the wave:
$$
y = 2A\ cos(\frac{\phi}{2})\ sin(kx - \omega t + \frac{\phi}{2})
$$</p>
<p>Also just to dump some formulas here:
$$
tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{L}
$$</p>
<p>And for &lsquo;small&rsquo; angles (typically $\approx \theta &lt; 10^\circ$
$$
tan(\theta) \approx sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{L}
$$</p>
<h3 id="reflection-1">Reflection</h3>
<p>Another way to measure reflection is by using a special kind of mirror and doing some stuff :)</p>
<p>We can calculate the reflection like:
$$
R = (\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2})^2
$$</p>
<h3 id="total-reflection">Total Reflection</h3>
<p>Total reflection is the phenomena that occurs when the transmission wave becomes parallel with the &lsquo;medium switch&rsquo;. This is quite an easy equation,
because in practice this just means that transmission wave has an angle of $90^\circ$.
$$
n_1\ sin(\theta_1) = n_2\ sin(\theta_2)
\newline
n_1\ sin(\theta_1) = n_2
$$</p>
<h3 id="interference-in-thin-layers">Interference in thin layers</h3>
<p>In thin layers the interference for light - we have to consider what medium we have before, inside and after.</p>
<p>If we have for example, air on both sides (which results in 1 phase shift), this will result in interfernce for maximum:
$$
2dn_2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} = m\lambda \text{, } m = 1, 2, 3, \dots
\newline
2dn_2 - \frac{\lambda}{2} = m\lambda \text{, } m = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots
$$</p>
<p>So generally:
$$
2dn_2 + \text{ev. phase shift} = m\lambda
$$</p>
<p>For the minima:
$$
2dn_2 = m\lambda \text{, } m = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots
$$</p>
<p>So generally:
$$
2dn_2 + \text{ev. phase shift} = m\lambda + \frac{\lambda}{2}
$$</p>
<h3 id="diffraction">Diffraction</h3>
<p>Diffraction is the phenomena that occurs when we have a width of our openings.
What happens is that, since we now, since we now have a opening with a width, there will be many light &lsquo;points&rsquo; that will radiate.
This means that these points, most likely, will have destructive interference with each other more often, than if we have just 2 light &lsquo;points&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This leads to:
$$
b \cdot sin(\theta) = m\lambda
$$</p>
<p>This is also why the intensity will wear off with distance.</p>
<h3 id="optical-resolution">Optical resolution</h3>
<p>So with this in mind, we can now understand why, if we have a big opening, for example a big lens, why the pictures come out better.</p>
<p>Because if we increase $d$, then $sin(\theta)$ must become larger.</p>
<p>We can also see this from:
$$
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda} = m \cdot N, \text{ where}
\newline
N - \text{ Amount of openings}
$$</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This was it for light waves - yes a very short part since a lot of the intuition and proofs are visual and I can&rsquo;t be bothered to put pictures of these at the moment :)</p>
<p>So take the formulas and go! :)</p>
