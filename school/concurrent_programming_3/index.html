		<section class="post">
			<p>In this part we&rsquo;ll cover how we can achieve mutual exclusion in a program using
only atomic read and writes.</p>
<h3 id="analyzing-concurrency">Analyzing Concurrency</h3>
<p>When analyzing concurrent programs we often look at <em>states</em> and <em>transitions</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>state</em> in these diagrams are <em>possible program states</em>.
<em>Transitions</em> on the other hand, <em>connects</em> these states to an execution order.</p>
<p>One to thing to note is that, the structural properties in these diagrams,
captures the semantics properties of the corresponding program.</p>
<h4 id="states">States</h4>
<p>A <em>state</em>, as we defined it, captures a possible state in a program.
Meaning it captures both shared and local variables and states in a concurrent program.</p>
<p>The initial state (starting point) is usually marked with an incoming arrow to indicate the start.
While, the final state of a program are usually marked with double-line edges.</p>
<h4 id="transitions">Transitions</h4>
<p>Transitions, as we defined them, connects these states. So it&rsquo;s natural that,
a transition is an arrow that connects two states.</p>
<p>Usually locking and unlocking are considered atomic operations, so each
lock and unlock will have their own visible transition.</p>
<h4 id="structural-properties">Structural properties</h4>
<p>As we said earlier, the structural properties of a transition diagrams tells
the semantics properties about the program.</p>
<p>This means for example that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mutual Exclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are no states where two (or more) threads are in their critical section</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadlock Freedom:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every (non-final) state, there is at least one outgoing transition to another state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starvation Freedom:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is (looping) path such that a thread never enters its critical section while trying to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Race Conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the final states have the same correct result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So we can see that it is very powerful to have these diagrams to analyze
programs and see what we achieve.</p>
<h3 id="mutual-exclusion-with-only-atomic-read-and-writes">Mutual exclusion with only atomic read and writes</h3>
<p>We know that we can achieve mutual exclusion using (good) locks and semaphores.
But can we achieve mutual exclusion in programs using only atomic read and writes?</p>
<p>It is in fact possible - but it&rsquo;s tricky however - but let&rsquo;s try to implement it.</p>
<h4 id="problem-description">Problem description</h4>
<p>Lets quickly go over what our problem is, so we have an easier time solving it.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>while(true) {
    entry protocol

    critical section {
        .
        .
        .
    }

    exit protocol
}
</code></pre><p>We want to design a (concurrent) program were we achieve, mutual exclusion,
freedom from deadlocks and freedom from starvation, in the following program.</p>
<h4 id="busy-waiting">Busy-waiting</h4>
<p>In the following attempts, we&rsquo;ll use something called busy-waiting.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>while(!condition) {
    // Do nothing
}
</code></pre><p>We will use the keyword <code>await(c)</code> which is not an actual keyword.
But we will use it as a synonym to the busy wait loop.</p>
<p>Note, we don&rsquo;t really want to use this in actual programs since there are better ways of waiting.
But for now this will do.</p>
<h3 id="naive-attempt">Naive attempt</h3>
<p>One of the most naive attempts one might try is to use a boolean list, called
<code>enter</code>.</p>
<p>So when thread $t_k$ wants to enter it sets <code>enter[k]</code>to true.</p>
<p>For example, if we use <code>k = 2</code> a program could look like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>while(true) {

    await(!enter[1]);

    enter[0] = true;

    critical section { ... }

    enter[0] = false;

}
</code></pre><p>In this, $t_0$ will wait until <code>enter[1]</code> becomes false.</p>
<p>While it seems like it <em>should</em> work, in reality it doesn&rsquo;t.
This does not guarantee mutual exclusion.</p>
<p>For example, this diagram illustrates well how:
<img src="/images/naive.png" alt="naive"></p>
<p>So $t_0$ enters into the line where it sets <code>enter[0]</code> to <code>true</code>.
But then $t_1$ does the same, before <code>enter[0]</code> actually becomes <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>So they will, in sequence set their respective flag to entered, and both enter the critical section.</p>
<p>So the problem seems to be that we have <code>await</code>.</p>
<h3 id="second-naive-attempt">Second naive attempt</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>while(true) {

    enter[0] = true;

    await(!enter[1]);

    critical section { ... }

    enter[0] = false;

}
</code></pre><p>So, if we make the change we noticed.</p>
<p>This solution actually achieves mutual exclusion! However, we still have a problem.
It does not guarantee freedom from deadlock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite easy to see a scenario where that happens, if $t_0$ first sets <code>enter[0]</code>to <code>true</code>,
then in turn $t_1$ sets <code>enter[1]</code> to <code>true</code>. They both now will wait on the other thread, a simple deadlock.</p>
<p>So it seems using independent variables will not work.</p>
<h3 id="third-naive-attempt">Third naive attempt</h3>
<p>By introducing a variable <code>yield</code> we can make sure that $t_k$ waits for its turn
while <code>yield</code> is <code>k</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>while(true) {
    await(yield != 0);

    critical section { ... }

    yield = 0;
}
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s important now that <code>await(condition)</code> was short for <code>while(!condition) { }</code>.
This means we will keep waiting until <code>yield</code>is something other than 0.</p>
<p>This means we either make the starting value of yield random, or just choose a default.</p>
<p>Thus, this solution does guarantee mutual exclusion, and freedom from deadlock.
But however, not from starvation.</p>
<p>Why? If a thread stops executing in its <strong>non-critical</strong> section, the other thread will starve.</p>
<h3 id="final-solution---petersons-algorithm">Final solution - Peterson&rsquo;s algorithm</h3>
<p>Our final solution will be a combination of our second and third attempt.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<p>$t_k$ <em>first</em> sets <code>enter[k]</code> to <code>true</code>, but then <em>lets other threads go first</em>, by setting <code>yield</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>while(true) {

    enter[0] = true;
    yield = 0;

    await(!enter[1] || yield != 0);

    /* Eqv. to
        while(enter[1] = true &amp;&amp; yield 0) { }

        Which means only enter when:

        enter[1] = false OR yield = 1
    */

    critical section { ... }

    enter[0] = false;
}
</code></pre><p>Peterson&rsquo;s algorithm ensure all three points that we want to achieve.</p>
<p>We can prove this but really isn&rsquo;t that interesting :P. However, we can use Peterson&rsquo;s algorithm
for <code>N</code>threads as well. It&rsquo;s a bit tricker to implement, but the idea is that we use a kind of &ldquo;filtering&rdquo;.
At each &ldquo;level&rdquo; we &ldquo;remove&rdquo; (yield) 1 thread and keep doing this until we have one singular thread left who &ldquo;won&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This thread will be allowed to enter the critical section.</p>
<h3 id="fairness">Fairness</h3>
<p>Although Peterson&rsquo;s algorithm ensure all three properties we listed,
but threads may access the critical section again before &ldquo;older&rdquo; threads.</p>
<p>There are several methods to make sure the algorithm is fair:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finite waiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a thread, $t$, is waiting to enter its critical section,
it will <em>eventually</em> enter it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bounded waiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a thread, $t$ is waiting to enter its critical section, the maximum
number of times <em>others</em> arriving threads are allowed to enter their critical section
before $t$, is <strong>bounded</strong> by a function of the number of contending threads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>$r$-Bounded waiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a thread $t$ is waiting to enter its critical section, the
maximum number of times other arriving threads are allowed to enter their critical
section before $t$ is less than $r + 1$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>First-come-first-served:</p>
<ul>
<li>0-bounded waiting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lamport&rsquo;s Bakery Algorithm is one algorithm which uses the First-come-first-served.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>Now that we know the theory behind it - we would want to implement it right?
Well, no, there are great implementations already out there,
but sometimes we can&rsquo;t always rely on exisiting libraries.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class PetersonLock implements Lock {
    private volatile boolean enter0 = false, enter1 = false;
    private volatile int yield;

    public void lock() {
        int myID = getThreadId();
        if (myID == 0) {
            enter0 = true;
        }

        else {
            enter1 = true;
        }

        yield = myID;

        while ((myID == 0) ? (enter1 &amp;&amp; yield == 0)
            : (enter0 &amp;&amp; yield == 1)) {

            // Do nothing
        }
    }

    public void unlock() {
        int myID = getThreadId();

        if (me == 0) {
            enter0 = false;
        }

        else {
            enter1 = false;
        }

    }

    private volatile long id0 = 0;
</code></pre><p>Now the thing is that we humans assume that the program will execute in the same order we wrote it.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t always the case, especially not with concurrent programs. The compiler likes to do a lot of optimizations,
that we may find odd, but it thinks it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>This is where we need to use the <code>volatile</code> keyword, which says to the compiler to not optimize this variable at all.</p>
<p>In Java however we can&rsquo;t have volatile arrays, but there is so called <code>AtomicArrays</code> we can use.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class PetersonAtomicLock implements Lock {
    private AtomicIntegerArray
        enter = new AtomicIntegerArray(2);

    private volatile int yield;

    public void lock() {
        int myID = getThreadId();
        int otherID = 1 - myID;
        enter.set(myID, 1);
        yield = myID;

        while (enter.get(otherID) == 1 &amp;&amp; yield == myID) {
            // Do nothing
        }
    }

    public void unlock() {
        int myID = getThreadId();
        enter.set(myID, 0);
    }
</code></pre><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This concludes this part, there was a lot of info in this one - but writing and implementating
good concurrent programs from scratch is a pain. I even left out how to implement a semaphore from scratch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll maybe update and put it in later :).</p>
