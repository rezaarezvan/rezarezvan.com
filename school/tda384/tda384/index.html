These are all big terms thrown around in the computer-science world.
For an outsider it can be quite confusing what these exactly are and how they differ from each other.
In this series we&rsquo;ll cover and dive into concurrency and its applications.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start by defining what we mean by concurrency.</p><h1 id=introduction>Introduction</h1><p>Concurrency, in its very definition is, the fact of two or more events or circumstances happening or existing at the same time.</p><p>If we apply this to computer-science, we can see that&rsquo;s a very natural thing.
Executing two or more events at the same time is something we would love. The only problem is that, we can not guarantee safety.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p><h4 id=simple-example>Simple example</h4><p>Let&rsquo;s look at a Java program which increments a simple counter:</p><p>In a sequential (non-concurrent) program this would be:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>public class Counter {
    private int counter = 0;

    public void run() {
        int cnt = counter;
        counter = cnt + 1;
    }

    public int counter() {
        return counter;
    }
}
</code></pre><pre tabindex=0><code>public class SequentialCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        counter.run();
        counter.run();

        System.out.println(counter.counter());
    }
}
</code></pre><p>This program will <strong>always</strong> print out 2. There&rsquo;s no doubt in that.</p><p>If we now introduce concurrency, we will now run these at the same time, or in <em>parallel</em>, do not confuse this with parallelism.
They&rsquo;re not the same.</p><p>So the idea is that we run the block of code we have on <strong>independent</strong> execution units (so-called threads in Java).</p><p>Specifically, in Java, these threads will run on the <strong>same</strong> <code>counter</code> object. So they will share the global variable called <code>counter</code>.</p><p>We, the programmers, don&rsquo;t have any control in what order these threads will be executed, this is the <em>schedulers</em> job.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>public class ConcurrentCounter extends Counter implements Runnable {
    /*

    threads will execute run()

    */
}
</code></pre><pre tabindex=0><code>public class ConcurrentCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentCounter counter = new ConcurrentCounter();

        Thread t = new Thread(counter);
        Thread u = new Thread(counter);

        t.start();
        u.start();

        try { t.join(); u.join(); }

        catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(&#34;Interrupted!&#34;);
        }

        System.out.println(counter.counter());
    }
}
</code></pre><p>If we compile and run this, we necessarily won&rsquo;t always get the expected answer, 2. In some (rare) cases, we will get the answer 1.</p><p>But if there is a risk for failure, why would we even want to write concurrent programs? Well, the answer can be described in three points.</p><ul><li>Abstraction<ul><li>By separating tasks and making sure we don&rsquo;t have to worry about them. For example downloading multiple files at once.</li></ul></li><li>Responsiveness<ul><li>We can provide a responsive, user interface by writing concurrent programs. For example, browsing YouTube while downloading files.</li></ul></li><li>Performance<ul><li>Splitting complex tasks, into smaller, subtasks will greatly increase the pure computer performance.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s also make one thing clear. Concurrency vs Parallelism. Concurrency is &ldquo;logical parallelism&rdquo; and parallelism is &ldquo;physical parallelism&rdquo; and parallelism is &ldquo;physical parallelism&rdquo;.</p><p>Parallelism is about taking advantage of redundant hardware.</p><p>Today, concurrency is everywhere, all operating-systems are based on concurrency and making sure things are speedy.</p><p>But these speedups aren&rsquo;t always free.</p><h1 id=amdahls-law>Amdahl&rsquo;s law</h1><p>Amdahl&rsquo;s law gives us an equation that, given $n$ processors (these are not necessarily physical processors but can be execution units) that can run in parallel.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the maximum speedup we can gain?
$$
\text{max speedup} = \frac{1}{(1 - p) + \frac{p}{n}}
$$</p><p>$p$ is the % of the program that is being run in parallel. By plugging in some arbitrary values we find quickly that, after a certain threshold, more parallelism doesn&rsquo;t help.</p><h1 id=terminology>Terminology</h1><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve looked at the basics, let&rsquo;s look at some important terminology.</p><p>A process is an <strong>independent unit of execution</strong>. It&rsquo;s an abstraction of a running sequential program.
This is what the operating system <strong>schedules</strong>, which <strong>process</strong> to run.</p><p>The <strong>scheduler</strong> is the system unit that is in charge of the <strong>process state</strong>.
There are 3 states in which a process can be in:</p><ul><li>Ready<ul><li>Ready to be executed, but not allocated to any execution unit.</li></ul></li><li>Blocked<ul><li>Waiting for an event to happen</li></ul></li><li>Running<ul><li>Running on some execution unit</li></ul></li></ul><p>A <strong>thread</strong> is a <em>lightweight process</em>. The actual difference between a process and a thread is fuzzy and implementation specific.</p><p>Our definition will be:</p><p>Process: Executing units that do <strong>not</strong> share memory.<br>Threads: Executing units that share memory.</p><p>An important thing to remember is that, threads (or execution units that share memory) <strong>communicate</strong> via memory.
While processes (or execution units that do not share memory) send real messages between the processes themselves.</p><p>These models are called, <strong>shared memory</strong> and <strong>distributed memory</strong>.</p><h1 id=traces>Traces</h1><p>A trace is an abstraction of concrete executions, these executions being:</p><ul><li>Atomic/linearized<ul><li>The effects of each thread appear as if they happened instantaneously.</li></ul></li><li>Complete<ul><li>The trace includes all intermediate atomic states.</li></ul></li><li>Interleaved<ul><li>The trace is an interleaving of each thread’s linear trace (in particular, no simultaneity).</li></ul></li></ul><p>What this means is, the sequence of <em>states</em> gives an execution <strong>trace</strong> of the concurrent program.</p><p>So different <em>traces</em> lead to different results in the program.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>This concludes this first part in this series, we&rsquo;ve only looked at the pure basics and terminology here.
In the next part we&rsquo;ll cover races, locks and semaphores, which are the first real concurrency principles we&rsquo;ll look at.</p></section></article><nav class=navigation><div class="nav-item previous"></div><div class="nav-item next"><a href=/school/tda384/tda384_2/ title="Next: Part 2 - Races, Locks, and Semaphores">Next &rarr;</a></div></nav></main></div><footer id=site-footer><div class=social-links><a href=https://github.com/rezaarezvan title class=social-link><span class=bracket>[</span>github<span class=bracket>]</span></a>
