		<section class="post">
			<p>In this part we&rsquo;ll cover the 2nd law of thermodynamics - as well as summarize this field of physics.</p>
<h3 id="direction-for-w-and-q">Direction for $W$ and $Q$</h3>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen the work, $W$ and $Q$ is quite important. So let&rsquo;s set up some general guide lines.</p>
<p>Generally, in a given thermal system:</p>
<p>A expansion, $(V_f &gt; V_i), \rightarrow W &gt; 0$ <br>
A compression, $(V_f &lt; V_i), \rightarrow W &lt; 0$</p>
<p>Increase in <strong>temperature</strong> $\Delta T &gt; 0, (T_f &gt; T_i), \rightarrow Q &gt; 0$ <br>
Decrease in <strong>temperature</strong> $\Delta T &lt; 0, (T_f &lt; T_i), \rightarrow Q &lt; 0$</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be quite tricky to know if the temperature increase or decreases - but there&rsquo;s a general rule for that as well.</p>
<p>Since we have $PV = nRT$, the farther away you are from the origin, the higher the temperature.</p>
<p>But we can always use $PV = nRT$ and see what kind of change we have in T.</p>
<h3 id="directions-of-the-different-processes">Directions of the Different Processes</h3>
<p>Now that we have a general understanding of directions, let&rsquo;s go back to our 4 different processes and see what directions they have.</p>
<h4 id="isobaric-process">Isobaric Process</h4>
<p><img src="/images/IsobarPlot.png" alt="Isobar"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a plot of a Isobar process - with two different directions.</p>
<p>In the above case, the gas <strong>increases</strong> in volume - therefore it has done a positive work. Using $PV = nRT$
we can see that T has to increase since P stays constant.</p>
<p>In the other case, it&rsquo;s just the opposite,  we decrease in V therefore a negative work has been done - same reasoning as before,
since P is constant T has to decrease as well.</p>
<p>$$
W_{12} &gt; 0
\newline
Q_{12} &gt; 0
$$</p>
<p>$$
W_{34} &lt; 0
\newline
Q_{34} &lt; 0
$$</p>
<h4 id="isochoric-process">Isochoric Process</h4>
<p><img src="/images/IsochoricPlot.png" alt="Isochoric"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a plot of a Isochoric process - with two different directions.</p>
<p>As we can can see, no work is being done by either of the processes. But we can say something about the temperature and Q.</p>
<p>In the case we increase in pressure, it also means T increases. Same logic goes for when P decreases, T decreases.</p>
<p>$$
W_{12} = 0
\newline
Q_{12} &gt; 0
$$</p>
<p>$$
W_{34} = 0
\newline
Q_{34} &lt; 0
$$</p>
<h4 id="isothermal-process">Isothermal Process</h4>
<p>In the isothermal process is a bit more tricky, but it becomes:</p>
<p>Positive direction
$$
W_{12} &gt; 0
\newline
Q_{12} &gt; 0
$$</p>
<p>Negative direction
$$
W_{34} &lt; 0
\newline
Q_{34} &lt; 0
$$</p>
<h4 id="adiabatic-process">Adiabatic Process</h4>
<p>In a adiabatic process, $Q = 0$ therefore it becomes:
$$
W_{12} &gt; 0
\newline
Q_{12} = 0
$$</p>
<p>Negative direction
$$
W_{34} &lt; 0
\newline
Q_{34} = 0
$$</p>
<h3 id="the-carnot-cycle">The Carnot Cycle</h3>
<p>The Carnot Cycle is a famous thermodynamic cycle since it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;upper-limit&rsquo; of any thermodynamic engine that transfers heat into work.
The proof of the carnot cycles efficiency is quite long and complicated one so I&rsquo;m not going to prove it but - the efficiency of a &lsquo;Carnot machine&rsquo; would be:
$$
e = \frac{T_h - T_c}{T_h}
$$</p>
<p>Or generally written as:</p>
<p>$$
e = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}
$$</p>
<h3 id="the-reverse-carnot-cycle">The Reverse Carnot Cycle</h3>
<p>Instead of using heat to perform work - we might want to cool something down or just transfer heat from one place to another. Then the efficiency doesn&rsquo;t tell us much.</p>
<p>Instead we look at something called coefficient of performance:</p>
<p>For a refrigeration cycle:
$$
K = \frac{Q_{in}}{Q_{out} - Q_{in}} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c}
$$</p>
<p>For heat pump:
$$
K = \frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{out} - Q_{in}} = \frac{T_h}{T_h - T_c}
$$</p>
<h3 id="thermodynamics-2nd-law">Thermodynamics 2nd Law</h3>
<p>Before we formally define the 2nd law - we first need to refresh our memory of what <strong>entropy</strong> and <strong>exergy</strong> is.
Very briefly, we can explain entropy as how &lsquo;unorganized&rsquo; a substance is. Exergy could be defined as the quality of energy, for example.</p>
<p>It takes $\approx$ 300 000 J of energy to heat 1 kg of $0^{\circ}C$ water to $70^{\circ}C$. If we <em>could</em> transfer all of this energy to kinetic energy, the water could have a speed of $\approx$ 770 m/s - but as we know, it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>But alright time to formally define the 2nd law:
$$
dS = \frac{dQ}{T}, dS_{System} \geq 0
$$</p>
<h3 id="combing-1st-and-2nd-law">Combing 1st and 2nd Law</h3>
<p>If we combine the 1st and the newly 2nd law - we will get:
$$
dU = T\ dS - P\ dv
$$</p>
<p>So now we can utilize something called &lsquo;TS&rsquo; diagrams instead of always using &lsquo;PV&rsquo; diagrams. In TS diagrams it&rsquo;s really easy to calculate Q.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This concludes this part and the series as a whole (probably). I really enjoyed writing and will probably continuing writing all my notes here, since I learn <strong>a lot</strong> doing this.</p>
