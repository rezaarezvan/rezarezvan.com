      <description>One of the core things that makes programming fun in my eyes are the standards and conventions that we&amp;rsquo;ve built. I want to write down my principles that I follow when writing code. I think it&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of every engineer that they have their own guidelines and principles they follow.&#xA;Consistency Before we even dive into an actual programming principle I want to talk about consistency. Guidelines and principles won&amp;rsquo;t even matter if we aren&amp;rsquo;t consistent with them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently felt the urge to make some math-related projects and visualization projects. So I picked up Julia and have so far learned the basics of the language - it&amp;rsquo;s a quite simple and dynamic language which I appreciate, especially after my most recent projects have been in C/C++ and Rust - it&amp;rsquo;s a great refresh in programming. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve made quite small projects with a lot of built-in libraries.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to learn Rust for a long time - I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled and manged to learn the basic syntax a while ago. However you haven&amp;rsquo;t truly learnt a language until you made a project and the code would be considered &amp;lsquo;idiomatic&amp;rsquo; - or at least in my opinion. So I decided to make a Vim-like text editor. I took a lot of inspiration from this post from medium, so all credits to Kofi.</description>
