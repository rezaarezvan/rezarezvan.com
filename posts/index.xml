      <title>DSA: Part 6 - Trees</title>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover so called &amp;rsquo;trees&amp;rsquo; in computer science. Warning, this will be a quite long part soooo&amp;hellip;
Trees The formal definition of a &amp;rsquo;tree&amp;rsquo; is: &amp;ldquo;A hierarchical data structure built up from nodes&amp;rdquo;.
So unlike a real tree which has its root at the bottom - the computer scientist flipped it - the root node is at the top of the tree.
In any tree there&amp;rsquo;s always one root node.</description>

      <title>DSA: Part 5 - Hash Tables</title>

      <description>Hash Tables Hash tables are one of the most famous (and widely used) data structures. But why are they so popular and powerful? Before we can answer that question we need to look back at sets and maps.
Sets and Maps in Context Just to refresh our memory - a set is a collection of items, where duplicates aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed. Maps are sets of keys, each having a associate value - or you can formulate it as - a set of key-value pairs.</description>

      <title>DSA: Part 4 - Abstract Data Types</title>

      <description>ADT vs Data Structures So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference betwen a Abstract Data Type and an actual datastructure?
An ADT is a kind of specification of something - it specifies how we can intertact with that object, like an API.
It consits of methods and constructors but also plain-text specifications (like the complexity for example) and explainations.
A data structure on the other hand is an actual implementation of an ADT. It specifies how the object works interally.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics: Lecture 3</title>

      <description>In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the 2nd law of thermodynamics - as well as summarize this field of physics.
Direction for $W$ and $Q$ As we&amp;rsquo;ve seen the work, $W$ and $Q$ is quite important. So let&amp;rsquo;s set up some general guide lines.
Generally, in a given thermal system:
A expansion, $(V_f &amp;gt; V_i), \rightarrow W &amp;gt; 0$ A compression, $(V_f &amp;lt; V_i), \rightarrow W &amp;lt; 0$
Increase in temperature $\Delta T &amp;gt; 0, (T_f &amp;gt; T_i), \rightarrow Q &amp;gt; 0$ Decrease in temperature $\Delta T &amp;lt; 0, (T_f &amp;lt; T_i), \rightarrow Q &amp;lt; 0$</description>

      <title>DSA: Part 3 - Dynamic Arrays</title>

      <description>Dynamic arrays Finally we have arrived at the DS of DSA. In (almost) all programming languages the most common built in data structure are arrays. We have seen them, worked with them - nothing new. We&amp;rsquo;ve probably even worked with dynamic arrays, they are an essential data structure - sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t know how much data we&amp;rsquo;ll need.
But how are dynamic arrays actually implemented into a language? The ideas is actually quite simple - we use a fixed length array and make a larger, fixed length, array when we have ran out of space.</description>

      <description>Ideal gases An &amp;lsquo;ideal&amp;rsquo; gas is a gas that is not subject to interparticle interactions. Also commonly said to not being subject to &amp;lsquo;react with other substances&amp;rsquo;.
In many applications of thermodynamics, ideal gases often come up, so it&amp;rsquo;s natural to understand them within a thermodynamic perspective.
Gases and Pressure Before we begin with the real thermodynamical part of gases we need a bit of background with gases. Boyle&amp;rsquo;s law gives us a mathematical formula for our intuition of gases.</description>

      <description>Introduction What do we mean by an &amp;lsquo;Algorithmic complexity&amp;rsquo;, a good (but not fully formal) definition would be - &amp;ldquo;How much resources does the algorithm use in relation to quantitative properties of its input&amp;rdquo;
And just to be clear, the definition of an algorithm: any well-defined procedure to solve a given problem.
So what kind of resources could we quantify from an input? Of course the runtime of a algorithm is important.</description>

      <title>DSA: Part 1 - Sorting</title>

      <description>My other course for this study period is a course in Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms.
Sorting &amp;amp; Searching We began this course with sorting and why it&amp;rsquo;s an important topic for a computer scientist. Sorting data comes up in all fields of computer science, everything from low-level, simple, array sorting - to sort millions of data gathered by an AI.
With this we began with simple sorting and searching algorithms. Firstly we began with binary search.</description>

      <description>In my physics course we have recently began with the thermodynamics part of physics. It&amp;rsquo;s quite overwhelming but at the same time it&amp;rsquo;s really fun. So I&amp;rsquo;ll just post and explain everything I learn in class here - since it&amp;rsquo;s a really good way of learning, explaining. As the late and incredible Richard Feynman once said: &amp;ldquo;If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand it&amp;rdquo; - Richard Feynman With that said, into thermodynamics!</description>

      <title>Julia projects</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently felt the urge to make some math-related projects and visualization projects. So I picked up Julia and have so far learned the basics of the language - it&amp;rsquo;s a quite simple and dynamic language which I appreciate, especially after my most recent projects have been in C/C++ and Rust - it&amp;rsquo;s a great refresh in programming. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve made quite small projects with a lot of built-in libraries.</description>

      <title>Vim-like editor</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to learn Rust for a long time - I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled and manged to learn the basic syntax a while ago. However you haven&amp;rsquo;t truly learnt a language until you made a project and the code would be considered &amp;lsquo;idiomatic&amp;rsquo; - or at least in my opinion. So I decided to make a Vim-like text editor. I took a lot of inspiration from this post from medium, so all credits to Kofi.</description>

      <description>One day each and one of us will die - this is a universal truth. I am writing this to keep my self accountable and remind my future self to recognize where I was and where I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to.
 Build/own my own place Make a difference in the world (well, hard to define) Fall in love Be successful working for myself (finical security) Create something meaningful (film, book, podcast etc) Live in another country Trace my ancestry Read 100 200 books Mentor someone Help someone else achieving their dreams Get a PhD Watch over 200 movies  </description>
