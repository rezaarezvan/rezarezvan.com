      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to learn Rust for a long time - I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled and manged to learn the basic syntax a while ago. However you haven&amp;rsquo;t truely learnt a language until you made a project and the code would be considerd &amp;lsquo;idomatic&amp;rsquo; - or atleast in my opinion. So I decided to make a Vim-like text editor. I took alot of inspiration from this post from medium, so all credits to Kofi.</description>
