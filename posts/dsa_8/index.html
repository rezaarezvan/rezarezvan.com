		<section class="post">
			<p>In this part we&rsquo;ll so called graphs and their applications.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-of-graphs">Introduction of Graphs</h3>
<p>A graph is a <em>set</em> of <strong>vertices</strong> connected <em>pairwise</em> by <strong>edges</strong>.
So a very natural thing is that these edged can be either undirected or directed!</p>
<p>A node can have a so called <strong>degree</strong> describing how many in/outgoing edges it has.
In the directed case we split this variable to &lsquo;out degree&rsquo; and &lsquo;in degree&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Another basic term that we&rsquo;ll encounter is a <strong>cycle</strong>.
A cycle is just as it sounds, a <em>cycle</em>, meaning that you start in a certain node and after a <em>walk</em> you end up in the same node again.</p>
<p>Also we can see the undirected graphs as directed graphs, but just having edges in both directions.
We&rsquo;ll mainly look at the use cases for directed graphs.</p>
<h3 id="pseudo-code-for-graphs">Pseudo Code for Graphs</h3>
<p>There are a lot of different ADT/API&rsquo;s for graphs, we&rsquo;ll be using this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Graph&lt;Vertices&gt;:
    // Adds an edge to the graph
    add_edge(e: Edge&lt;Vertices&gt;)

    // Removes an edge from the graph
    remove_edge(e: Edge&lt;Vertices&gt;)

    // Returns true if the edge is present in the graph, otherwise false
    contains_edge(e: Edge&lt;Vertices&gt;) -&gt; boolean

    // Returns all the edges which are connected with the vertices
    outgoing_edges(from: Vertices) -&gt; Collection&lt;Edge&lt;Vertices&gt;&gt;

    // Returns the number of vertices present in the graph
    n_vertices() -&gt; Int

    // Returns the number of edges present in the graph
    n_edges() -&gt; Int
</code></pre><p>Now this depends on the <code>Edge</code> class which will be implemented as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Edge&lt;Vertices&gt;:
    from   : Vertices
    to     : Vertices
    weight : float = 1.0
</code></pre><h3 id="graph-representation">Graph Representation</h3>
<p>We can represent a graph by doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of edges</li>
<li>An adjacency list</li>
<li>An adjacency matrix</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="representation-set-of-edges">Representation: Set of edges</h4>
<p>We can use set data structure for this. If the graph is undirected we only need to keep one pair of the direction.
This is a quite good implementation for undirected graphs,
since the complexity of finding all adjacent neighbors to a vertex v would be $\mathcal{O}(E)$,
where E is the total number of edges in the graph.</p>
<p>It can look something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>0 1
0 2
0 5
0 6
3 4
3 5
4 5
4 6
7 8
9 10
9 11
9 12
11 12
</code></pre><p>We can look at these as tuples, where $(v_1, v_2)$ means that $v_1$ has a connecting edge to $v_2$.
This is directed, but as we said, if we have an undirected graph, then it is enough to store just one of them.</p>
<h4 id="representation-adjacency-list">Representation: Adjacency list</h4>
<p>We maintain a <em>map</em> from vertices to collections of edges, we could alternatively also do a collection of vertices.</p>
<p>If the graph is <strong>undirected</strong>, then we need to include <strong>both</strong> directions.</p>
<p>The complexity for iterating over all the vertices adjacent to a vertex is $\mathcal{O}(v_a)$,
we can write this as $\mathcal{O}(degree(V))$.
So it&rsquo;s really good, note this is if the lookup for the key is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.</p>
<h4 id="representation-adjacency-matrix">Representation: Adjacency matrix</h4>
<p>We maintain a 2d $V \times V$ boolean array. Where true represent a connecting edge.</p>
<p>The complexity of this is quite bad, since we need to loop through one of the dimensions, the complexity becomes $\mathcal{O}(V)$.</p>
<h4 id="representation">Representation</h4>
<p>In most real-world cases we use adjacency lists</p>
<h3 id="implementation">implementation</h3>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to implement a directed graph using a adjacency list!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Graph&lt;V&gt;:
    all_edges    : Map&lt;V, Collection&lt;Edge&lt;V&gt;&gt;&gt;
    n_edges      : int
    all_vertices : Set&lt;V&gt;

    outgoing_edges(from: V) -&gt; Collection&lt;Edge&lt;V&gt;&gt;:
        return all_edges.get(from)

    contains_edge(e: Edge&lt;V&gt;) -&gt; boolean:
        return e in outgoing_edges(edge.from)

    add(e: Edge&lt;V&gt;):
        outgoing = outgoing_edges(e.from)

        if e not in outgoing:
            outgoing.add(e)
            n_edges += 1
            all_vertices.add(e.from)
            all_vertices.add(e.to)

    remove(e: Edge&lt;V&gt;):
        outgoing = outgoing_edges(e.from)
        if edge in outgoing:
            outgoing.remove(e)
            n_edges -= 1
</code></pre><h3 id="searching-in-graphs">Searching in Graphs</h3>
<p>In many real-world applications, graphs will represent some sort of maze, or other structure, where we want to find a path.
Sometimes the path with least resistance/weight/length. There are two primary search algorithms for graphs.</p>
<p>So called <strong>D</strong>epth-<strong>F</strong>irst <strong>S</strong>earch or DFS for short. The other called <strong>B</strong>readth-<strong>F</strong>irst <strong>S</strong>earch or BFS for short.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with DFS.</p>
<h4 id="depth-first-search">Depth-first search</h4>
<p>Depth-first search is a way to traverse a graph systematically.</p>
<p>A short pseudo-code of a DFS would be:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>DFS(to visit a vertex v):
    mark v as visited
    recursively visit all unmarked vertices w adjacent to v
</code></pre><p>We&rsquo;ve encountered DFS for trees, the difference here as we can see is that we &lsquo;mark&rsquo; each vertex we visit.
Because in a graph, there might be cycles, so we don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in them.</p>
<p>Applications of using a DFS are usually,
finding all vertices connected to a source vertex, or simply, finding a path between two vertices.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-1">Implementation</h4>
<p>To implement this we need data structures! To store all marked vertices, we will use a Set.
To keep track of the path we&rsquo;ve taken, we&rsquo;ll use a map which contains vertices tuples.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>recursiveDFS(v : V):
    add v to visited
    for edge in outgoing_edges(v):
        w = endpoint of edge
        if v not in visited:
            recursiveDFS(w)
            cameFrom[w] = v
</code></pre><h3 id="breadth-first-search">Breadth-First Search</h3>
<p>For our DFS we used a underlying stack for our recursive calls, the function stack.</p>
<p>BFS uses a <em>queue</em> instead of stack, so we have to implement this ourselves.</p>
<p>So a break down of what we have to do:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>BFS(from a starting vertex s):
    put s into FIFO queue, mark as visited
    while queue not empty:
        dequeue a vertex v
        for each unmarked vertex w adjacent to v:
            enqueue w, mark it as visited
</code></pre><p>So really, the only difference for BFS in trees compared to graphs is that we have to keep track of the visited vertices.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-2">Implementation</h4>
<p>So a pseudo-code implementation would look something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>iterativeBFS(start: V):
    visited = new Set&lt;V&gt;
    agenda = new Queue&lt;V&gt;
    agenda.enqueue(start)

    while agenda is not empty:
        agenda.dequeue(v)
        if v not in visited:
            add v to visited
            for edge in outgoing_edges(v):
                w = endpoint of edge
                if w not in visited:
                    add w to agenda
</code></pre><p>If we want to retrace our steps, we would need a <code>cameFrom</code> Map as in the DFS.</p>
<p>Also one thing to note, if we replace the queue, with a stack, we&rsquo;ll just end up with a <code>iterativeDFS</code> instead!</p>
<h4 id="bfs-properties">BFS properties</h4>
<p>In a BFS search, what do we actually get/perform? We get a path yes -
but it&rsquo;s always the <strong>shortest</strong> path from <code>s</code> to all other vertices!
It actually does this in $\mathcal{O}(E + V)$</p>
<h4 id="implementation-calculating-the-distance">Implementation: Calculating the distance</h4>
<p>In this implementation we&rsquo;ll add a map that hold the distances between every vertex.
(I also added that cameFrom map that I discussed earlier)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>iterativeBFS(start: V):
    visited = new Set&lt;V&gt;
    agenda = new Queue&lt;V&gt;
    cameFrom = new Map&lt;V,V&gt;
    distTo = new empty Map&lt;V, Int&gt;

    agenda.enqueue(start)
    distTo[start] = 0

    while agenda is not empty:
        agenda.dequeue(v)
        if v not in visited:
            add v to visited
            for edge in outgoing_edges(v):
                w = endpoint of edge
                if w not in visited:
                    add w to agenda
                    cameFrom[w] = v
                    distTo[w] = 1 + distTo[v]
</code></pre><h3 id="example-problems">Example Problems</h3>
<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve seen DFS, BFS and understood graphs - let&rsquo;s see what we can do with them.</p>
<p>A very important kind of graph is a <strong>DAG</strong>, or a Directed <strong>acyclic</strong> graph. This means the graph doesn&rsquo;t contain any cycles.</p>
<p>This is especially useful for scheduling, for example. But we need to know if a graph contains a cycle - how can we detect a cycle?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very common problem that many application implement into their programs.
There are multiple ways of detecting a cycle in a graph, for example,
we can use a DFS, and if we encounter a node that we&rsquo;ve visited before, we know that we have a cycle.</p>
<p>Also a good note here, If we ever want the <em>preorder</em>, <em>postorder</em> or <em>reverse postorder</em> we just modify our DFS by one line -
we change where the enqueue/push goes.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>DFS(v : V):
    visited.add(v)
    preorder.enqueue(v)
    for w in outgoing_edges(v):
        if w not in visited:
            visited.add(w)
    postorder.enqueue(v)
    reversePostorder.push(v)
</code></pre><p>Note that the reversePostorder is a stack, therefore we will get the reverse order.</p>
<p>There are many finding &lsquo;connected components&rsquo; problems, here&rsquo;s a good picture to illustrate what we can use and not:

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it for graphs - in the next part we&rsquo;ll cover <em>minimum spanning trees</em> and more <em>shortest path algorithms</em>.</p>
