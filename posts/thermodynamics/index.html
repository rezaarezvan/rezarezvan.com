		<section class="post">
			<p>In my physics course we have recently began with the thermodynamics part of physics.
<br>
<br>
It&rsquo;s quite overwhelming but at the same time it&rsquo;s really fun. So I&rsquo;ll just post and explain everything I learn in class here -
since it&rsquo;s a really good way of learning, explaining. As the late and incredible Richard Feynman once said:
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<em>If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don&rsquo;t understand it</em>&rdquo; - Richard Feynman
<br>
<br>
With that said, into thermodynamics!</p>
<h2 id="thermodynamics-and-theory-of-heat">Thermodynamics and Theory of Heat</h2>
<h3 id="thermal-efficiency">Thermal Efficiency</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with something which is quite simple to understand. The famous quote that 
&ldquo;Energy is neither created nor destroyed, only changed from one form to another&rdquo;.
With this in mind we understand that we never &lsquo;create&rsquo; energy. It&rsquo;s also a sensible conclusion that if we had machines with 100% efficiency,
we wouldn&rsquo;t have whole fields in physics about energy-efficiency.</p>
<h4 id="informal-definition-of-thermal-efficiency">Informal definition of thermal efficiency</h4>
<p>(We will later define a more formal definition of thermal efficiency)
$$
e - [\text{Dimension less}], 0 \leq e \leq 1
\newline
e = \frac{\text{Useful energy}}{\text{Total input energy}}
$$</p>
<h5 id="real-life-examples">Real Life Examples</h5>
<p>A usual car that runs on gas has a efficiency of $\approx$ 20-25% (e $\approx$ 0.2 - 0.25)</p>
<h3 id="thermal-expansion">Thermal expansion</h3>
<p>Imagine we have a block of some kind of material. If we apply heat to this block it&rsquo;s natural that it will expand.
The same logic goes if we lower the heat/temperature - it will compress instead.</p>
<h4 id="formula-for-thermal-expansion">Formula for Thermal Expansion</h4>
<p>$$
L = L_0(1 + \alpha \Delta T)
\text{, where:}
\newline
\alpha - \text{Expansion coefficient } [K^{-1}]
$$</p>
<p>This is for a 1D expansion, if the expansion happens in 2D it is:</p>
<p>$$
L = L_0(1 + \beta \Delta T)
\text{, where:}
\newline
\beta - \text{Expansion coefficient } [K^{-1}]
\newline
\text{Note: } \beta \approx 2\alpha
$$</p>
<h3 id="thermal-conductivity-for-simple-geometric-objects">Thermal Conductivity for Simple Geometric Objects</h3>
<p>Say if we have a system of 2 bodies, one which gains energy/heats up from an external source, with a opening to the second body.
<br>
<br>
This will transfer the heat from the hot body, $T_h$ to the colder body $T_c$ since some heat will be lost in the transfer.
The opening has a so called thermal conductivity, the ability to transfer heat. With this in mind we can derive.</p>
<p>$$
P = \frac{dQ}{dt} = Ak \frac{T_h - T_c}{l}
\text{, where:}
\newline
P - \text{Effect } [W]
\newline
Q - \text{Heat exchange } [J]
\newline
A - \text{Cross-sectional Area}
\newline
k - \text{Thermal Conductivity } [\frac{W}{mK}]
\newline
l - \text{Length of the opening}
$$</p>
<p>We can rewrite this also as:
$$
P = -Ak \frac{dT}{dx}
\text{, or more general}
\newline
P = -Ak \nabla T
$$</p>
<h3 id="thermal-conductivity-for-more-complex-geometric-objects">Thermal Conductivity for more Complex Geometric Objects</h3>
<p>For more complex geometric shapes, we need to consider how the thickness of the body increases/decreases. For example, for a cylinder, the formula becomes: $$ P = -kA\frac{dT}{dr} = -k 2 \pi l r \frac{dT}{dr} $$
If we&rsquo;re looking at a cylinder that generates heats in it&rsquo;s core for example, being near the core (small inner radius) will obviously be warmer than being at its surface (larger inner radius)</p>
<p>Since $2\pi l$ is always constant - we can rewrite the equation and integrate both sides to get:</p>
<p>$$
\int_{T_h}^{T_c} -\frac{k 2\pi l}{P} = \int_{R1}^{R2} \frac{dr}{r} \rightarrow P =  \frac{2\pi k l}{ln(\frac{R2}{R1})} (T_h - T_c)
$$</p>
<p>Where $R1$ and $R2$ are two inner-radii to the cylinder.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a system which upholds a certain temperature $T_i$ with an constant effect of $P$ - Now consider if we cut the constant effect of heat, $P$
and let the system naturally cool down due to its surrounding temperature being $T_c$. We can describe this relation with the following:</p>
<p>$dQ = -c m dT$</p>
<p>Where $c$ is the conductivity coefficient and m is the mass of the substance</p>
<ul>
<li>with a bit of rewriting and integrating we also get:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\int_{T1}^{T2} \frac{dT}{T - T_0} = \int_0^t \frac{-kA}{lcm} dt \rightarrow  ln(\frac{T_2 - T_0}{T_1 - T_0}) = -\frac{kA}{lcm}t
$$</p>
<h3 id="what-thermal-conductivity-really-means">What Thermal Conductivity really means</h3>
<p>Just so we understand the equation $Q = cm\Delta T$ - 
the $c$ coefficient tells us how much energy we need to put into a substance to change it&rsquo;s temperature.
For example, $\approx$ 4180 J are required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 &lsquo;kelvin&rsquo;. 
Often we can use $^\circ$C as well - but this is due to the difference between two temperature being absolute.
So really it&rsquo;s a increase in any kind of temperature, just by <strong>1</strong> index.</p>
<h3 id="latent-heat">Latent Heat</h3>
<p>Last thing we&rsquo;re about to cover is the so called &lsquo;Latent heat&rsquo; release of required to transition from one phase to another. 
The formula for how much energy is needed is:</p>
<p>$Q = mL$</p>
<p>Where $L$ - specific latent heat for a particular substance [J/kg]</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This was everything for the first part of the thermodynamics, 
in the next time we&rsquo;ll looking into how gases behave and why they are so important for thermodynamics.</p>
