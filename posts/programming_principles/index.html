        <section class="body">
            <p>One of the core things that makes programming so fun in my eyes are the standards and conventions that we&rsquo;ve built.
I want to write down my principles that I follow when writing code. I think it&rsquo;s an essential part of every engineer that they have their own guidelines and principles they follow.</p>
<h4 id="consistency">Consistency</h4>
<p>Before we even dive into an actual <em>programming</em> principle I want to talk about consistency.
Guidlines and principles won&rsquo;t even matter if we aren&rsquo;t consistent with them.
I understand that each team or company will have their own principles to follow.
But I believe that, having and trying to stick to your own principles, will ultimately lead to better code.</p>
<h4 id="naming-system">Naming system</h4>
<p>A famous quote that many programmers have probably heard before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only two hard things in Computer Science, cache invalidation and naming things&rdquo; - Phil Karlton.</p>
<p>While I believe there are more than two hard things in computer science, it is true that naming is one of them.
Having a naming convention or system is essential to having a readable and clean codebase.
I could write a whole blog post just about naming things - but I&rsquo;ll suffice to naming a few principles that I follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be explicit but concise:</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many (horrific) examples one could talk, but in reality it&rsquo;s quite simple.</p>
<p>Name your things accordingly, no one (and certainly not your future self)
will understand what the variable <code>a</code> represents. But as in all cases, there are edge cases, sometimes names can be too explicit.
<code>IndexVariableForArrayIndex</code> can just be <code>idx</code>. This is a hard thing to master -
I&rsquo;m certain that any seniors that have read my code probably saw flaws in my own naming conventions, but let&rsquo;s try to learn, all of us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan before naming</li>
</ul>
<p>When creating a larger project I believe it&rsquo;s plan what to name things before <em>actually</em> naming them.
It&rsquo;s easy to just begin naming structs, classes, objects etc without <em>really</em> planning for their use or even worse, future improvements.
That&rsquo;s why I strive for to follow a naming system that be expanded upon.</p>
<h4 id="backup-your-things">Backup your things</h4>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a programming principle, rather a principle all programmers should follow.
Backup your shit, shit can (and probably will) happen one day. There are plenty of tools that allow one to backup their files easily.
Sometimes a simple symlink script will suffice as well. I myself just keep all my dot files in a <a href="https://github.com/rezaarezvan/.dotfiles">repository</a>.</p>
<h4 id="kiss--dry">KISS &amp; DRY</h4>
<p>There a lot of principles and acronyms that are meant to remind a programmer to write good, clean solutions that can be reused for later use.</p>
<p><strong>KISS - Keep it simple, silly</strong><br>
<strong>DRY - Don&rsquo;t repeat yourself</strong></p>
<p>Are two that I like, it reminds one to keep it simple and never repeating yourself.
Which are great guidelines when it comes to writing good and readable code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping it simple</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, implementing the easy and bruteforce solution <strong>first</strong> is the best.
You have a working solution and now have the time and energy to find a better working one.</p>
<p>In many scenarios it&rsquo;s often the more complex solutions that result in greater results -
but these complex solutions are probably built from the simpler solutions.
That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s important to keep it simple, <em>for a start</em> then trying to expand on your solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t repeat yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>This one should be obvious for many - programming it self allows us to solve problems with many iterative steps.</p>
<p>So writing code that is reusable is a important guideline. Write functions that have their own distinct functionality.</p>
<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
<p>Testing your code, solution, algorithm, you name it. Testing will always lead to finding small bugs or improvements that can be made.
Also for any beginners that might read this, I&rsquo;ve heard so many beginners to programming asking &ldquo;will this work?&rdquo;, &ldquo;is this correct?&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>My answer is always the same - just try it! - you and me are no compilers so we can&rsquo;t be sure.
A funny quote that I like is: &ldquo;Fuck around to find out&rdquo;. One can really apply this to any area of life - but I think this certainly holds true for programming.</p>
<h4 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h4>
<p>When I mean ergonomics I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean your posture. I mean developer ergonomics, how comfortable are you with the tools you use everyday?</p>
<p>Is there maybe a tool or service that can make you even more comfortable and productive? In recent years we have seen the rise of a AI companion.
Copilot and chatGPT are certainly something that a lot of developers seem to love. I myself are neutral in those at the moment writing this.</p>
<p>But really knowing, understanding and being comfortable with your OS, editor, WM, programming language, framework, etc.
Will ultimately yield better code, and certainly at a faster rate. So try something new, it just might be the thing that boosts your productivity.</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>The common theme in this post is that, trying out new stuff and finding what fits you, and really sticking to those things -
is what makes a great engineer in my eyes.
I hope my words had some impact and the person reading this, will try to find their own programming principles, and sticking to them.</p>
