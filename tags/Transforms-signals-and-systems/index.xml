      <title>Transforms, signals and systems: Part 6 - Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll define and understand Fourier transforms. In the last part we covered the concept of Fourier series.
Which was a way of describing periodic functions as a linear combination (sum) of simple trigonometric functions. The Fourier transform takes this one step further, it&amp;rsquo;s a way to extend the Fourier series of non-periodic functions.
Definition Given a function in the time-domain, the equivalent function in the frequency domain is: $$ F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-j\omega t}\ dt $$</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll try to understand the concept and power with Fourier series.
Let&amp;rsquo;s firstly define the what, why and how with Fourier series.
Definition Fourier series, is an expansion of a perodic function, into a sum of trigonometric functions.
So the power is really, given a complex perodic function, we can easily represent it as a sum of simple trigonometric functions!
However, before we mathematically define the Fourier series, let&amp;rsquo;s take a different approach to this.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we will learn about systems that can be modeled with differential equations.
Definition Some systems whose input, $f(t)$, and output, $y(t)$, are related by linear differential equations, often have the form: $$ \dfrac{d^n y}{dt^n} + a_{n - 1} \dfrac{d^{n - 1}y}{dt^{n - 1}} + \ldots + a_1 \dfrac{dy}{dt} + a_0 y(t) = $$
$$ b_m + \dfrac{d^m f}{dt^m} + b_{m - 1} + \dfrac{d^{m - 1} f}{dt^{m - 1}} + \ldots + b_1 \dfrac{df}{dt} + b_0 f(t) $$</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we will learn about the convolution operation and how it&amp;rsquo;s used.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start at how it&amp;rsquo;s used.
Use case Given this signal, we want to find activity on the graph, besides the notice. A kind of high-pass filter will do the job. A high-pass filter is precisely doing the convolution operation to filter.
For example the output for this input can be: Definition and properties Let&amp;rsquo;s call our input signal $x(t)$, our system operation for $h(t)$ and our output for $y(t)$.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we will learn to classify systems and recognize a Linear-Time Invariant System
Let&amp;rsquo;s first define what a system is.
Systems Our definition of a system will be:
An entity that processes a signal/a set of signals to yield another signal/set of signals.
The input, also called excitation, goes through the system and the system spits out an output, also called response.
Interconnection We can have multiple systems.</description>

      <description>Introductions In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll cover what we mean with transforms, signals and systems. How they relate and are used in the real world.
Signals In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll try to understand signals, classify these. Perform different signal operations and lastly understand and use signal models. Let&amp;rsquo;s first define what a signal is
Definition A signal is a set of information or data. Any physical quantity that varies over time, space or any other variable or variables.</description>
