      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can represent systems using matrix notation, also called space-state representation. Along with how we linearize non-linear systems.
State variables If we use the spring-mass system from last time, with $F_d$ as input signal and $y$ as output signal.
We obtained the following differential equation: $$ \ddot{y} = \dfrac{1}{m}(F_d - b\dot{y} - ky) $$
If we want to represent this system using a set of first-order differential equations instead, we can do the following:</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can model mechanical systems with controls.
Models for mechanical systems In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll mainly deal with springs and dampers. Mainly translation motion.
For springs, we&amp;rsquo;ll of course use Hooke&amp;rsquo;s law: $$ F_s = ky $$
Where $k$ is the spring constant in $\left[\dfrac{N}{m}\right]$.
For dampers, we&amp;rsquo;ll use: $$ F_y = b \dot{y} $$
Where $b$ is the damping constant in $\left[\dfrac{Ns}{m}\right]$.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll define regulators in the Laplace domain.
Let&amp;rsquo;s firstly cover feedback again.
$N$th-Order systems In controls, we&amp;rsquo;ll often study system which can be described with differential equations. A $N$th-order system means we can describe said system with a $N$th-order differential equation.
We also say that the transfer function has degree $N$.
Feedback system Let&amp;rsquo;s find the general transfer function for a feedback system, from $r(t)$ to $y(t)$.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll define what a transfer function is for a system, and why they are important.
Let&amp;rsquo;s firstly cover feedback again.
Feedback system As we discussed last time we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter:
$v(t)$ - Interference $u(t)$ - Control signal/Input signal $y(t)$ - Response signal/Output signal $r(t)$ - Reference value $e(t)$ - Control error Let&amp;rsquo;s take a real world example
Example Say that we have a system which regulates temperature. We have an initial temperature for 19$^\circ$a.</description>

      <description>Introduction Control theory plays a pivotal role in modern systems, ranging from electronics to transportation and industry. In this series, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the fundamentals of how we can effectively control systems to achieve desired behaviors.
Definitions Throughout this series, we will delve into methods that ensure systems behave in a desirable manner.
In a typical system, we encounter:
$v(t)$ - Interference $u(t)$ - Control signal/Input signal $y(t)$ - Response signal/Output signal Control Control involves producing the output signal solely from the control signal, without any feedback or compensation for disturbances.</description>
