      <description>PD-controller Given that $u(t) = K_p(e(t) + T_d \dot{e}(t))$
In the $s$-domain, the PD controller is: $$ F_{PD}(s) = \dfrac{U(s)}{E(s)} = K_p(1 + T_d s) $$
PD-controller are often paired with low-pass filters (LP), so that $\dot{e}(t)$ doesn&amp;rsquo;t become to large.
$$ \begin{align*} F_{PD}(s) &amp;amp; = K_p(1 + \dfrac{T_d s}{1 + T_f s}) \\ &amp;amp; = K_p(\dfrac{1 + (T_d + T_f) s}{1 + T_f s}) \\ &amp;amp; = K_p(\dfrac{1 + \tau_d s}{1 + \frac{\tau_d}{b} s}) \ | \ \tau_d = T_d + T_f, b = \frac{T_d + T_f}{T_f} \end{align*} $$</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can design different type of controllers to make a system behave as wanted.
PD-controller $$ G(s) = \dfrac{K}{s(1 + sT)} $$
$$ F(s) = K_p + K_d s $$
The loop transfer function is: $$ L(s) = F(s)G(s) = \dfrac{K(K_p + K_d s)}{s(1 + sT)} = \dfrac{\frac{K}{T} (K_p + K_d s)}{s^2 + \frac{1}{T} s} $$
$$ G_{ry}(s) = \dfrac{L(s)}{1 + L(s)} = \dfrac{\dfrac{\frac{K}{T} (K_p + K_d s)}{s^2 + \frac{1}{T} s}}{1 + \dfrac{\frac{K}{T} (K_p + K_d s)}{s^2 + \frac{1}{T} s}} = \dfrac{\frac{K}{T}(K_p + K_d s)}{s^2 + \frac{1}{T} s + \frac{K}{T}(K_p + K_d s)} = \dfrac{K_p \frac{K}{T} + K_d \frac{K}{T} s}{s^2 + (1 + K_d K) s + K_p \frac{K}{T}} $$</description>

      <title>Control theory: Part 9 - General controller structure</title>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we define a general feedback loop.
General controller structure Assume the general structure for a feedback loop.
However, we now have some noise that is added (in theory the sign can be whatever) to our out signal. Additionally, the noise, $V(s)$ will go through a process, $G_v(s)$.
Along with this noise we have some noise in the feedback loop as well, so-called measurement error.</description>

      <title>Control theory: Part 8 - Stability</title>
      <link>https://rezvan.xyz/school/ERE103_8/</link>

      <guid>https://rezvan.xyz/school/ERE103_8/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll properly define what stability is for different kind of systems.
Stability $G(s)$ is a stable system when:
$$ \lim_{t \to \infty} g(t) = 0 $$
Where $g(t)$ is the system impulse response, meaning $u(t) = \delta(t)$, which yields:
$$ g(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{G(s) = \dfrac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = Y(s) \} $$
Example $G(s) = \dfrac{1}{s^2 + 4s - 5}$
We can rewrite it as: $$ G(s) = \dfrac{1}{s^2 + 4s - 5} = \dfrac{1}{(s - 1)(s + 5)} $$</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll begin with the part about frequency analysis.
Test functions Often when we want to test our system to determine the overall stability, time it takes and the response we get.
We often test with our unit step function: $$ \sigma(t) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;amp; t \leq 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; t &amp;lt; 0 \end{cases} $$
We call a system response to the unit step function for unit step response.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can go from a given space-state representation to the systems transfer function and vice-versa.
From space-state to transfer function Given this space-state representation: $$ \begin{cases} \dot{x} &amp;amp; = Ax + Bu &amp;amp; (1) \\ y &amp;amp; = Cx + Du &amp;amp; (2) \end{cases} $$
We want to find $G_{uy}(s) = \dfrac{Y(s)}{U(s)}$
Let&amp;rsquo;s Laplace our equation system: $$ \begin{cases} sX(s) &amp;amp; = AX(s) + BU(s) &amp;amp; (1) \\ Y(s) &amp;amp; = CX(s) + DU(S) &amp;amp; (2) \end{cases} $$</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can represent systems using matrix notation, also called space-state representation. Along with how we linearize non-linear systems.
State variables If we use the spring-mass system from last time, with $F_d$ as input signal and $y$ as output signal.
We obtained the following differential equation: $$ \ddot{y} = \dfrac{1}{m}(F_d - b\dot{y} - ky) $$
If we want to represent this system using a set of first-order differential equations instead, we can do the following:</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can model mechanical systems with controls.
Models for mechanical systems In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll mainly deal with springs and dampers. Mainly translation motion.
For springs, we&amp;rsquo;ll of course use Hooke&amp;rsquo;s law: $$ F_s = ky $$
Where $k$ is the spring constant in $\left[\dfrac{N}{m}\right]$.
For dampers, we&amp;rsquo;ll use: $$ F_y = b \dot{y} $$
Where $b$ is the damping constant in $\left[\dfrac{Ns}{m}\right]$.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll define regulators in the Laplace domain.
Let&amp;rsquo;s firstly cover feedback again.
$N$th-Order systems In controls, we&amp;rsquo;ll often study system which can be described with differential equations. A $N$th-order system means we can describe said system with a $N$th-order differential equation.
We also say that the transfer function has degree $N$.
Feedback system Let&amp;rsquo;s find the general transfer function for a feedback system, from $r(t)$ to $y(t)$.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll define what a transfer function is for a system, and why they are important.
Let&amp;rsquo;s firstly cover feedback again.
Feedback system As we discussed last time we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter:
$v(t)$ - Interference $u(t)$ - Control signal/Input signal $y(t)$ - Response signal/Output signal $r(t)$ - Reference value $e(t)$ - Control error Let&amp;rsquo;s take a real world example
Example Say that we have a system which regulates temperature. We have an initial temperature for 19$^\circ$a.</description>

      <description>Introduction Control theory plays a pivotal role in modern systems, ranging from electronics to transportation and industry. In this series, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the fundamentals of how we can effectively control systems to achieve desired behaviors.
Definitions Throughout this series, we will delve into methods that ensure systems behave in a desirable manner.
In a typical system, we encounter:
$v(t)$ - Interference $u(t)$ - Control signal/Input signal $y(t)$ - Response signal/Output signal Control Control involves producing the output signal solely from the control signal, without any feedback or compensation for disturbances.</description>
