      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some principles when it comes to data visualization&#xA;Five-point summary The five-point summary is a very common and effective summary of data to get a quick overview and feeling for the data.&#xA;To understand what the five-point summary tells us, let&amp;rsquo;s first understand quantiles and quartiles.&#xA;A quantile is a cut-point of a distribution (or a dataset). Quantiles are usually obtained by sorting the data and selecting an appropriate value at an appropriate rank.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;re going to discuss different data munging techniques.&#xA;Data munging is the process of transforming &amp;ldquo;raw&amp;rdquo; data into a readable format.&#xA;One of the most common processes is when we want to scrape data from a website.&#xA;HTML The web is built on Hypertext Markup Language.&#xA;HTML form a tree of nested elements, marked with tags.&#xA;&amp;lt;p class=&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;&amp;gt; bar &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; This creates a paragraph element.&#xA;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;url&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;text&amp;#34;&amp;gt; This creates an image element.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore some popular Python tools for data science.&#xA;NumPy Numerical Python, is the standard package for computation and array operations.&#xA;Low-level functions are written in C, therefore, very fast.&#xA;Basic operations in NumPy We usually import as:&#xA;import numpy as np NumPy arrays can be constructed with the following:&#xA;A = np.array([69, 420, 1337, 42]) A NumPy array is defined by:&#xA;The number of dimensions it has (ndim) The number of elements it has (size) Its shape (number of elements along an axis) Its dtype A = np.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the very large and mystical field of data science and AI. We&amp;rsquo;re going to spend these first few parts to understand what data science is.&#xA;Data science What is data science? (Theoretical) Computer science is method-driven and often abstract. In data science, the question is often answered with insights derived from the data.&#xA;Data scientists aim for results that can describe the world, or a business sector, that needs it.</description>
