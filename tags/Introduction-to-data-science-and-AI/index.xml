      <description>Introduction In this part we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore some popular Python tools for data science.&#xA;NumPy Numerical Python, is the standard package for computation and array operations.&#xA;Low-level functions are written in C, therefore, very fast.&#xA;Basic operations in NumPy We usually import as:&#xA;import numpy as np NumPy arrays can be constructed with the following:&#xA;A = np.array([69, 420, 1337, 42]) A NumPy array is defined by:&#xA;The number of dimensions it has (ndim) The number of elements it has (size) Its shape (number of elements along an axis) Its dtype A = np.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the very large and mystical field of data science and AI. We&amp;rsquo;re going to spend these first few parts to understand what data science is.&#xA;Data science What is data science? (Theoretical) Computer science is method-driven and often abstract. In data science, the question is often answered with insights derived from the data.&#xA;Data scientists aim for results that can describe the world, or a business sector, that needs it.</description>
